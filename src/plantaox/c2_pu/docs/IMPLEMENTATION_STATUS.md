# Implementation Status — Component 02 (PU-AOP)

**Last updated:** 14 October 2026
**Update rule:** Any agent (Claude Code, Codex) or person completing, starting, or blocking on a task MUST update this file in the same session the change happens. Do not let this file go stale — it is the single source of truth for "what's actually done" versus the aspirational task list in `PU_AOP_PP1_Microsoft_Planner_Buckets_and_Tasks.md`.

**Target dates (unofficial, confirm against actual schedule):** PP1 presentation 26 Oct 2026, checklist submission 30 Oct 2026.

## ✅ Completed tasks

### Bucket 1, Tasks 1.1–1.7 — FR1 Positive Pool: Curation, Conflict Resolution, CD-HIT, GraphPart, Freeze
- **Status: technical acceptance passed, frozen as `pp1_baseline_v1` (2026-10-14).** Full detail,
  methodology, every number, and the acceptance-checklist mapping live in
  **[`fr1_acceptance_report.md`](fr1_acceptance_report.md)** — this entry is a pointer + headline
  numbers, not a duplicate of that report.
- **Important distinction (AGENTS.md rule #3):** "technical acceptance passed" is not "FR1 is
  scientifically signed off." Four items are explicitly pending supervisor approval (see
  `fr1_acceptance_report.md` §10) and are **not** blocking — they're documented limitations a
  defensible PP1 baseline is allowed to carry, not things silently glossed over.
- **Headline numbers:** 1,205 accepted positives (670 E1 + 535 E2) → 925 CD-HIT 90%-identity
  clusters (0 dropped) → 834 GraphPart 40%-identity 5-fold-split sequences (91 excluded for
  cross-fold homology, zero residual violations in GraphPart's own convergence report).
- **Reproducibility re-verified 2026-10-14:** full pipeline re-run from raw inputs produces
  byte-identical outputs (automated via `tests/c2_pu/test_fr1_reproducibility.py`, not just a manual
  check) — confirmed no stochastic steps exist in Buckets 1.1–1.6.
- **Provenance chain verified end-to-end:** every retained sequence traces to a named, typed source
  (`tests/c2_pu/test_fr1_provenance_acceptance.py`, 13 tests); peptide IDs form an unbroken,
  duplicate-free chain from the raw-source merge through every stage boundary.
- **Known gap, explicitly not fixed here (out of 1.7's scope):** Bucket 1.1/1.2's formal
  `data_registry.csv` was never created as a standalone artifact. SHA-256 checksums of the two raw
  source files are recorded in `fr1_acceptance_report.md` §4 as a stopgap, not a substitute — flagged
  for separate follow-up, not silently treated as done.
- **Frozen baseline:** `data/processed/c2_pu/frozen/pp1_baseline_v1/` (10 files + checksummed
  `MANIFEST.json`, via `plantaox.c2_pu.curation.freeze`). Per AGENTS.md rule #4, do not regenerate or
  mutate this directory in place — a genuine future change gets a new version ID (`pp1_baseline_v2`),
  logged with a reason for superseding this one.

## 🔄 Current work in progress

### Bucket 2, Task 2.1 — C1 Random Decoy Construction
- **Status:** Pipeline built and functioning; full-file validation **not yet done**.
- **What exists:** A Colab/Python script that queries UniProtKB REST (`reviewed:true AND length:[3 TO 50]` plus keyword exclusions), applies a secondary Python keyword blocklist, randomly samples 5,000 records (seed 42), and writes a provenance log.
- **Latest run stats:** 8,830 candidates after query filter → 8,233 after secondary filter → 5,000 sampled.
- **What's NOT done:**
  - The full 5,000-record `stage_c1_decoys.fasta` has never been directly inspected — only six rounds of 25-record random previews.
  - No automated test yet exists to re-check the *entire* final file against the blocklist (as opposed to a random slice).
  - Reproducibility hasn't been formally re-verified (re-running from scratch and diffing against the saved file).
  - Task 2.1's remaining checklist items (accession/fragment-coordinate mapping, exclusion log formatting) per the Planner breakdown are not yet done.
- **Next action:** see Next Tasks below — full-file validation script, then formal close-out of 2.1.

## ⚠️ Known issues / open risks

1. **C1 source ambiguity (supervisor sign-off needed):** Proposal says "SwissProt" (FR2/SO2) vs "UniRef50" (§3.2.2). We've adopted UniProtKB `reviewed:true` (= SwissProt) as the working interpretation — see `PU_AOP_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md` §4 for rationale. **This has not been confirmed with supervisors yet.** Flag in next consultation.
2. **Residual filtering imperfection is expected, not a bug.** Six rounds of manual review caught progressively more obscure contamination (toxins → hormones → AMPs → antioxidant enzymes → metallothionein → frog skin peptides). This is diminishing returns, not an unresolved defect. The agreed plan is to document it as a limitation in the FR2 report (see `PU_AOP_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md` §7), **not** to keep iterating indefinitely. Do not reopen this unless full-file validation (above) finds something structurally different from the spot-check pattern.
3. **Full-file validation gap** (see Current Work above) — this is the one open item that *does* need closing before C1/FR2 can be marked complete, as distinct from #2 which is an accepted limitation.
4. **A real case-sensitivity bug occurred once already** (keyword added with a capital letter never matched because `.lower()` was only applied to the description, not the keyword). Fixed via the list-comprehension lowercasing pattern in `PU_AOP_RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md` §5. Any agent editing the blocklist should be aware this class of bug is easy to reintroduce.
5. **179 of 1,384 candidate positives (Multi-AOP ∩ AnOxPePred-inactive) are cross-source contradicted — resolved, but needs supervisor visibility.** See Bucket 1 section above. Excluded from both the positive pool and the external control pending manual review; logged in full in `label_conflicts_anox_vs_multiaop.csv`. This is the exact "contradictory labels across databases" phenomenon the proposal's own lit review (p.14, citing Isaac et al.) names as a field-wide problem — worth citing directly in the FR1 report as in-practice confirmation of the research motivation, not just a data-cleaning footnote.
6. **C1 decoy pool has only 3,786 unique sequences across its 5,000 FASTA records** (checked directly against the full file, not a sample). Short 3–50 AA fragments repeat across species for biologically ordinary reasons (conserved motifs), so this isn't necessarily a defect, but it means the "5,000 records" acceptance criterion (Bucket 2.7, FR2 checklist) is satisfied at the record level, not the unique-sequence level — needs an explicit decision on which one the acceptance checklist actually means before FR2 sign-off.
7. **One known AOP positive sequence (`DRVYIHPF`) was found inside the existing C1 decoy FASTA** — direct sequence-identity leakage between Stage C1 and the positive pool. Expected: C1 was built (2026-10-07) before the FR1 positive pool existed, so its only contamination screen was the generic bioactivity keyword blocklist, not a direct identity check. This is exactly what Bucket 2.4 ("Find and resolve overlap among challenge pools and curated positives") is for — flagging here so it isn't missed, not proposing a new policy.

## ⏭️ Next tasks (in order)

1. **Get supervisor sign-off on the four pending FR1 approvals** (`fr1_acceptance_report.md` §10) —
   the conflict-resolution policy, the E2 provisional-tier default, the C1 source ambiguity, and the
   missing formal `data_registry.csv`. None block continued FR2/FR3 work on `pp1_baseline_v1`, but
   FR1 isn't *scientifically* closed until these are addressed.
2. **Close out 2.1 (C1) properly**, now with two new concrete findings to fold in:
   - Decide whether "5,000 records" (Bucket 2.7 acceptance criterion) means 5,000 FASTA entries or
     5,000 unique sequences — currently 3,786 unique (see Known Issues #6).
   - Run Bucket 2.4's positive-vs-C1 identity check now that the FR1 positive pool exists; at least
     one known positive (`DRVYIHPF`) is currently sitting inside the C1 decoy file (Known Issues #7).
   - Confirm record count, length range 3–50 AA, re-run reproducibility, and finish the
     accession/fragment-coordinate mapping and exclusion log artifacts still outstanding from the 2.1
     checklist.
3. **In parallel: begin ESM-2 environment setup** (Bucket 3, task 3.2) — the `pu_aop` WSL conda env
   built for CD-HIT/GraphPart is a natural place to add PyTorch/fair-esm too, since it already solves
   the "no root access" problem this environment has.
4. **Task 2.2 (C2 — Peptipedia bioactive pool)** can start any time; not blocked on anything above.
5. Continue down the Bucket 1 → Bucket 2 → Bucket 3 → Bucket 4 sequence as defined in `PU_AOP_PP1_Microsoft_Planner_Buckets_and_Tasks.md`, respecting the FR1+FR2-first priority.

## 📝 Experiment decisions log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | Use UniProtKB `reviewed:true` instead of raw UniRef50 bulk FASTA for C1 sampling | Matches FR2/SO2 wording ("SwissProt"); UniRef50's `reviewed` field doesn't exist on that endpoint (confirmed via live 400 error); avoids an unnecessary ~13GB download | 
| 2026-10-07 | Random seed fixed at 42 for all C1 sampling | Reproducibility requirement — any re-run must produce an identical 5,000-record set from the same candidate pool |
| 2026-10-07 | Stopped iterating on keyword-filter perfection after round 6 | Diminishing returns — each round caught progressively more obscure single-digit-count contamination; agreed to document as a known limitation instead of open-ended chasing (see risk #2 above) |
| 2026-10-07 | Query-level keyword exclusions: Toxin, Hormone, Neuropeptide, Antimicrobial, Antibiotic, Antioxidant, "Amphibian defense peptide" | Based on UniProt's own controlled-vocabulary keywords (confirmed IDs: KW-0929 Antimicrobial, KW-0044 Antibiotic, KW-0049 Antioxidant, KW-0878 Amphibian defense peptide); chosen over trying to enumerate every peptide family name in Python alone |
| 2026-10-14 | Component 02 is self-contained under `src/plantaox/c2_pu/` (own `common/` and `curation/` subpackages) instead of using the shared top-level `src/plantaox/common/`/`curation/` | The shared top-level folders were empty scaffold stubs with no agreed interface and no other member had started using them yet; keeping PU-AOP self-contained avoids unilaterally defining a cross-component contract and keeps this component independently gradable. Flag for supervisor/team discussion if a genuinely shared utility layer is wanted later. |
| 2026-10-14 | `data_registry.csv` is kept component-scoped at `data/processed/c2_pu/data_registry.csv` for now, instead of a single shared top-level registry | AGENTS.md's "don't duplicate the registry" rule assumes one shared `data_registry.csv` already exists, but none does yet and no shared convention has been agreed with the other 3 members. Documented here rather than silently picked; flagged for consolidation once the team agrees on a shared registry convention. |
| 2026-10-14 | Cross-source conflict policy: a Multi-AOP positive contradicted by AnOxPePred's own assay (FRS=0 AND Chelator=0) is excluded from BOTH the positive pool and the external control, logged with full provenance, and flagged as a manual-review/external-control candidate — never silently dropped, never auto-reclassified as E3 | Assay-level evidence (AnOxPePred, per-sequence) outranks an undocumented benchmark annotation (Multi-AOP, no per-record assay metadata), matching the E1>E2 precedence the whole tiering scheme is built on. Confirmed with the project owner 2026-10-14; this resolved 179 of 1,384 candidate positives. Flag for supervisor sign-off — it materially affects both the positive-pool count and the external-control size. |
| 2026-10-14 | Multi-AOP-only positives (no AnOxPePred row) default to E2, explicitly provisional (`evidence_basis="benchmark_positive_annotation"`, `assay_verified="unknown"`), flagged for supervisor review and promotable to E1 later if primary-source assay evidence is recovered | Multi-AOP provides no per-record assay-type metadata — only a bare binary label (its `name` column is a leftover train/test split tag, not a provenance ID) — so E1 cannot be defensibly claimed for these. Confirmed with the project owner 2026-10-14; affects 553 of 1,205 accepted positives (pre-CD-HIT). |
| 2026-10-14 | Positive pool applies the shared 3–50 AA length window (same as C1/C2/C3), dropping 45 sub-3-AA sequences, rather than keeping the full literature-cited 2–50 AA range | Keeps positives and unlabeled pools on the same length distribution so the curriculum can't trivially shortcut on length; documented in the FR1 report rather than silently applied. Confirmed with the project owner 2026-10-14. |
| 2026-10-14 | `run_fr1_positives` output tables are sorted by `peptide_id` before writing, instead of leaving them in whatever order Python's internal `set` iteration happened to produce | The positive-pool build used set operations whose iteration order is randomized per Python process (hash-seed randomization) — harmless for a flat table, but CD-HIT's representative selection for exact-tie clusters depends on input FASTA order, so an undeterministic order would have broken task 1.7's "same seed -> same output" reproducibility check once CD-HIT (1.5) started consuming this file. Fixed before generating any CD-HIT input; re-ran, counts unchanged. |
| 2026-10-14 | CD-HIT word length set to `-n 2` instead of the officially recommended `-n 5` for 90% identity | 417 of 1,205 positives (35%) are under 5 AA; a 5-mer index cannot be built for shorter sequences, which would silently exclude over a third of the pool from clustering. A shorter word length only costs CD-HIT speed/sensitivity — the identity threshold itself is still enforced exactly, it is not relaxed. Confirmed with the project owner 2026-10-14 (explicit short-peptide-edge-case requirement). |
| 2026-10-14 | CD-HIT, GraphPart, and EMBOSS (needle/needleall) installed into a user-space `pu_aop` micromamba environment inside WSL Ubuntu, instead of `apt install` | No root access was available to this agent in this environment (no sudo password); `apt-cache policy` confirmed all three packages exist, but `sudo apt install` needs an interactive password. Micromamba installs entirely under `$HOME`, no root needed. All WSL tool invocations now go through `common/wsl.py`'s `run_in_conda_env`, which activates this env. |
| 2026-10-14 | GraphPart's identity denominator (`-dn`) set to `full` (GraphPart's own default), not `shortest` (which would have matched CD-HIT's own identity definition) | First attempt used `shortest` for cross-stage consistency with CD-HIT, and GraphPart failed outright ("Impossible to generate the desired 5 partitions... loss of 4 complete partitions"). Root cause, confirmed empirically: 71% of CD-HIT representatives are under 10 AA, and `shortest`-denominator identity for very short peptides is dominated by chance matches, collapsing the partition graph into one component. Tested length floors (7 AA still fails, 8 AA "succeeds" but gives a degenerate 357/2/5/1/1 split, 10 AA gives a clean split but throws away 71% of the pool) before trying `full`, which resolved the collapse cleanly on the complete 925-sequence pool with no data loss from a length floor. CD-HIT (90% identity, redundancy removal) and GraphPart (40% identity, leakage prevention) are different problems; they don't need the same identity definition. |
| 2026-10-14 | GraphPart splits are label-stratified by evidence tier (`-ln tier`, via `write_stratified_fasta`'s `\|tier=E1`/`\|tier=E2` FASTA headers), not left unstratified | An unstratified 5-fold split put 86% E1 in fold 0 vs 34% E1 in fold 4 — a real confound for any per-fold metric comparison in FR3/FR4/FR6. Stratifying narrowed the range to 44–64% E1 across folds, at the cost of less even fold sizes (124–266) and slightly more sequences excluded for homology (91 vs 84). Not requested explicitly, but cheap and clearly worth it; flagged here for visibility rather than silently applied. |
| 2026-10-14 | FR1 declared technically accepted and frozen as `pp1_baseline_v1`, with scientific/supervisor sign-off tracked as a separate, still-open item rather than bundled into the same status | AGENTS.md rule #3 requires acceptance evidence before marking a task complete, and that evidence (reproducibility, provenance chain, leakage checks, full-file tests) is now in hand — see `fr1_acceptance_report.md`. But conflating "the pipeline is correct and reproducible" with "the conclusions are supervisor-approved" would overclaim; the four pending-approval items (fr1_acceptance_report.md §10) are listed separately so neither status gets confused for the other. |
| 2026-10-14 | `data_registry.csv` (Bucket 1.1/1.2) is explicitly logged as NOT done, rather than fabricating one or quietly treating the per-stage provenance logs as a substitute | No formal source registry (IDs, license, access date, release/commit hash) was ever built; `fr1_positive_pool_provenance.jsonl` and this file capture run-level provenance, which is not the same artifact. Inventing placeholder registry content (e.g. a guessed access date) would be worse than naming the gap. Flagged in `fr1_acceptance_report.md` §4/§9 for separate follow-up, out of Bucket 1.7's scope. |
